    - 'Full guardianship: court arrangement where guardian has all parental powers
      because parental rights are suspended or terminated; full guardian can consent
      to major decisions (marriage, adoption) with court approval'
    - 'Limited guardianship: voluntary arrangement with parental consent; requires
      Limited Guardianship Placement Plan (LGPP) outlining terms like parenting time
      and support; parents retain residual rights; guardian''s authority is more restricted
      (cannot consent to marriage or adoption)'
    - 'Key distinctions: Full guardianship is used when parents are unavailable or
      unfit (court fully substitutes parental authority); limited guardianship is
      used when parents proactively agree to temporary care; in full guardianship,
      parental rights are suspended; in limited, parents remain involved per the LGPP'
